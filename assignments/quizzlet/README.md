Write a program that loops over a dictionary of words and quizzes the user for their corresponding Spanish translations, keeping count of how many the user gets correct! Separate each question and answer with a blank line to help with visual clarity.

Here's a sample run of the program (user input is surrounded by "<>"):

```
What is the Spanish translation for hello? <hola>
That is correct!

What is the Spanish translation for dog? <gato>
That is incorrect, the Spanish translation for dog is perro.

... (quizzes user on the rest of the words)
That is correct!

You got 6/8 words correct, come study again soon!
```
