# Romeo vs Juliet
In this challenge, you are given a file called `romeo_vs_juliet.txt` that contains the text of the play "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare. Your task is to read in the file and count the number of times that "Romeo" and "Juliet" are mentioned in the text.

Once you have those counts, you will create a bar chart that displays the number of mentions of each character. The x-axis should be the character names ("Romeo" and "Juliet") and the y-axis should be the number of mentions.
The final graph should look similar to the png labeled `expected_plot.png` in this folder.

**Note that you should plot the amount of times "Romeo" and "Juliet" are mentioned in dialogue or stage directions, not the amount of times they speak. It may be helpful to look at the .txt file to see what the difference is.**

# Extension 1 (Optional)
Now, we are interested in the number of times Romeo speaks, vs the number of times Juliet speaks. Make a bar chart that displaying this information.


# Extension 2 (Optional)
!!!CHALLENGE!!!
Now we are interested in the number of times any character speaks. Make a bar chart that displays the number of times each character speaks in the play. The x-axis should be the character names and the y-axis should be the number of times they speak. Note, you may have to manually filter out a few "names" that are not characters, but for the most part you can automatically detect the names.
