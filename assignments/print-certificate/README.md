# Print Certificate
In this challenge, you will use functions to print an certificate in the console.

You can see how the certificate should look in `example.png`. Not that each line of the certificate should be printed using a function call, but that you don't need one unique function for each line.

The width of the certificate is 10 characters (NOT including the "|" that act as borders). The hyphenated lines contain 9 and 8 hyphens respectively.
