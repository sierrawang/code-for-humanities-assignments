# Caesar Cipher (Part 1)
A Caeser cipher is an encryption technique that involves shifting the letters of a message alphabetically by some fixed number.

For example, if the secret message is:
> hello world
and the shift number is 3, the encrypted message would be:
> khoor zruog

As "k" is 3 letters after "h", "h" is 3 letters after "e", "o" is 3 letters after "L" and so on.

In this program, we implement the encoding part of a Caeser Cipher. The user will be prompted to enter a message and a shift number. The program will then output the encrypted message.

Example output:
```
Enter a message: hello world
Enter a shift number: 3
Encrypted message: khoor zruog
```
