# Count Numbers
In this challenge you will read in a file, `numbers.txt`, that contains a one number per line. You should use a dictionary to store the count of each number. Once the file is completely read, print the count of each number 1 by 1. 

The final output should look something like this:
```
5 appears 3 times
4 appears 4 times
...
7 appears 3 times
```
