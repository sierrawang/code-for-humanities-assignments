# Filter Romeo and Juliet
In this folder, we have a file called `romeo_and_juliet.txt` that contains the text of the play "Romeo and Juliet" by William Shakespeare.

The text file contains many lines, but we are interested in isolating the lines that *mention* "Romen" and "Juliet". We are focused on just the individual lines, not necessarily the full quote or context.

*Hint:* Take a look at the text file to see how "Romeo" and "Juliet" are cased (uppercase vs lowercase) when they are mentioned in a quote as opposed to when they are the one speaking.

Finally, output each of these lines to a file called `output.txt` in this folder.
