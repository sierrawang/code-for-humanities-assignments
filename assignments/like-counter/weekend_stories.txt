Alice: So, like, I went to the Dish on Saturday morning, and it was, like, so beautiful. I, like, ran the whole trail and, like, felt amazing. The weather was, like, perfect, and I, like, couldn't have asked for a better start to my weekend. After that, I, like, met up with some friends for brunch, and it was, like, so much fun.

Bob: I went surfing in Santa Cruz, and it was, like, totally awesome. The waves were, like, perfect, and I, like, caught some great ones. We, like, spent the whole day at the beach, and it was, like, so relaxing. Later, we, like, had a bonfire and, like, watched the sunset. It was, like, the perfect day.

Charlie: I went to, like, a concert in SF, and it was, like, the best, like, night ever. The band was, like, incredible, and I, like, danced all night. The venue was, like, packed, and the energy was, like, amazing. I, like, met some new people and, like, had a blast. I can't wait to, like, go to another concert soon.

Dana: I went to see Stanford play Cal in water polo, and it was, like, such an intense game. Stanford, like, totally dominated, and it was, like, so satisfying to see. The Cal Bears were, like, trying their best, but they, like, couldn't keep up with our team. The crowd was, like, super hyped, and it was, like, the perfect way to spend a Sunday afternoon. Go Cardinal!
