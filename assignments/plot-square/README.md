# Plot Square

In this assignment, you are randomly generating points in a square.

You should generate 1000 random x, y points that are in a 1 x 1 square, then plot them on a graph using `plt.scatter`.
Recall that `random.random()` generates a random float between 0 and 1.

The final graph should look similar to the png labeled `expected_plot.png` in this folder.

# Extension 1 (Optional)
This could be a good time to mess around with stylisting things, like changing the color of the points, or the size of the points, or the background color of the plot.
