# Song Recommendation System
Using the AI library, can you make a program that takes in user preferences, then recommends a song? In this case, you should take in a `genre`, a `mood`, and a `decade` from the user. The final output of the program should look like this:
```
Enter a music genre: Rock
Enter your mood: Happy
Enter a decade for your song to be from: the 1970s
Finding a song for you...

Try listening to: "Don't Stop" by Fleetwood Mac
```
Another potential output could be:
```
Enter a music genre: Popular in the time period
Enter your mood: Man in 1100 CE
Enter a decade for your song to be from: 1100 CE
Finding a song for you...

Try listening to: "Chant of the Divine Office" - Various Artists
```
